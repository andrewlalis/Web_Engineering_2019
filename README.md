# Web_Engineering_2019
Within this repository, you'll find a wonderous treasure trove of code and documentation, all of which is the sole property of Andrew, George, and Tom, and may not be distributed or modified in any way without prior written approval from one of the aforementioned authors. We thank you for your cooperation.

## Where to Find Things
* `dataset/` - Here you'll find the raw, unedited JSON dataset as obtained from the link supplied by the lecturer.
* `documentation/` - Here you'll find the documentation produced during the course (API Specifications, Design, and Requirements) under their respective directories.
* `source/` - The base directory for the source code of the project.

## Branch Organization
When creating branches to work on, please follow the conventions listed here.
* The `master` branch should only be pushed to via pull-requests from the `development` branch.
* The `development` branch represents the current working version of the project as a whole. Thus, only completed features should be merged into development, and tested, before anything is sent to `master`.
* Individual features should be developed on named branches beginning with the main author's initials. For example, a branch created by Andrew to add an airports endpoint should be named `agl/add_airports_endpoint`.
